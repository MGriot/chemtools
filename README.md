# chemtools

**chemtools** is a Python library designed to simplify chemometric analyses. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing various operations, including:

**1. Data Preprocessing:**
- Autoscaling
- Correlation matrix calculation
- Diagonalization of matrices
- Calculation of matrix mean and standard deviation
- Variance calculation

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis:**
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**3. Regression Analysis:**
- Linear Regression (including confidence and prediction bands)

**4. Utility Functions:**
- Heatmap generation and annotation
- Array manipulation (e.g., converting arrays to columns, reordering)
- Variable type checking
- Random color generation
- Saving and loading models

## Package Structure

The library is organized into four main modules:

- **preprocessing:** Contains functions for data preprocessing.
- **explotation:** Houses classes and methods for exploratory data analysis (e.g., PCA).
- **regression:** Provides implementations of regression models (e.g., Linear Regression).
- **utility:** Includes various utility functions to assist with data handling, visualization, and more.

## How to Use

Refer to the [documentation](doc/Documentation.md) for detailed information on how to use the library. 

## Examples

Check out the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) in the repository for practical examples of how to use **chemtools**.
