# Categorical Data Plots

This document covers plots specifically designed for visualizing datasets containing only categorical variables.

## Heatmap of Co-occurrences

While a standard heatmap visualizes a numerical matrix, it can be adapted to show the relationship between two categorical variables. By creating a contingency table (crosstab) that counts the co-occurrences of categories, we can visualize this table as a heatmap. The color of each cell represents the frequency of the combination of categories.

The `HeatmapPlot` class provides a convenient `plot_categorical` method for this purpose.

```python
from chemtools.plots.relationship.heatmap import HeatmapPlot

# plotter = HeatmapPlot()
# plotter.plot_categorical(data, x_column='Hair Color', y_column='Eye Color')
```

**Example:**
![Categorical Heatmap](../../img/plots/categorical/heatmap_categorical_classic_professional_light.png)
<details>
  <summary>Dark Theme Version</summary>
  ![Categorical Heatmap Dark](../../img/plots/categorical/heatmap_categorical_classic_professional_dark.png)
</details>

## Mosaic Plot

A mosaic plot is a graphical representation of a contingency table. The plot is divided into rectangles, where the area of each rectangle is proportional to the frequency of that cell in the table. This makes it an excellent tool for visualizing the relationships and proportions between two or more categorical variables.

The `chemtools` implementation uses `statsmodels` for the `matplotlib` backend and a `treemap` for the `plotly` backend, as it provides a similar representation.

```python
from chemtools.plots.categorical.mosaic import MosaicPlot

# plotter = MosaicPlot()
# plotter.plot(data, columns=['Hair Color', 'Eye Color'])
```

**Example (matplotlib):**
![Mosaic Plot](../../img/plots/categorical/mosaic_plot_mpl_classic_professional_light.png)
<details>
  <summary>Dark Theme Version</summary>
  ![Mosaic Plot Dark](../../img/plots/categorical/mosaic_plot_mpl_classic_professional_dark.png)
</details>

**Example (plotly - Treemap):**
![Mosaic Plot (Treemap)](../../img/plots/categorical/mosaic_plot_plotly_classic_professional_light.png)
<details>
  <summary>Dark Theme Version</summary>
  A dark theme version can be generated by setting `theme` in the plotter, similar to the matplotlib example.
